I have been thinking of starting a technical blog for a long time now but my procrastination always got the better of me. However, I cannot wait to start blogging after I stumbled upon [Jekyll][jekyll] recently. It just seem so technically fun to be using Jekyll for blogging. So here I am with my very first post written in [Markdown][markdown].


The purpose of the blog is to share my technical experiences on Hadoop cluster administration, Apache Spark and coding (probably Python). Maybe I will document some parenting tips here as well. ;)
