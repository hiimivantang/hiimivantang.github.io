## So what does Data Science mean? 

I've heard and read different definitions and `making data work for you` is the most succint way of describing data science. And how do we make data work for us? With computer science, statistics, domain knowledge and some coding glue, we can leverage data to build systems that really benefit us!<br>


## Why the hype?

Although the term data science was coined a few years ago, the interest is still growing! With the confluence of various factors such as cheaper and bigger storage, big data and also the end of AI winter, there is no doubt why data science is so hot now.
